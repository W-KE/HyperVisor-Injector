- this is perfect if you are starting up a p2c 



# before using you must do this
Please enable hyper-v in "turn windows features on or off". Then run launch.bat as admin, this will mount the EFI partition and move some files around then reboot you. Voyager is designed to recover from a crash. The first thing Voyager will do when executed is restore bootmgfw on disk. If any complications occur during boot you can simply reboot.

## [ How To Use Injector ? ] 

make sure your dll is in the same folder 
**re-name** your dll to **test.dll** if not it wont inject
**the dll must be in the same folder as the injector**
- **have your game open** 
-  **Open the injector -> then type out your game ( if this doesnt work type the window class name ) **
-  **hit enter key after you have typed it out then wait for it to inject**


# having issues on Windows 11 ?
- type this as admin in cmd
- reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\CI\Config /v "VulnerableDriverBlocklistEnable" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
- reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity/v "Enabled" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

To apply the changes, you will need to reboot the system.


## How to find the class to inject into ?
- head over to https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/winlister.html and download winlister x64 or x32
- open it up look for your process for my example i will use notepad
- double click on the process that you are wanting to inject into 
- then find Class: and copy that and paste it into the injector
